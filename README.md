# Secrets of the Framework Creators

This is a tutorial that [Kumar McMillan](https://github.com/kumar303) and I prepared for [PyCon 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20090426205120/http://us.pycon.org/2008/tutorials/FrameworksHsu/). Sadly, the original page is down, so I decided to put all the source code for it on GitHub.

Since this was originally written 7 years ago, there are naturally some things that are out of date, but for the most part, the topics are mostly relevant and the code still runs on Python 2.7.
