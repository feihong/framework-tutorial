- first half lecture, second half exercises ("kata")
- todo: clean up rst section formatting
- hand out should contain basic points for lecture, actual content of slides (as markers), and detailed instructions for exercises
- todo: using rst to create s5-compatible slides (div class "slide") for lecture
- todo: zip file of all material.  html links to source code.  this should be the same as the printed handout?
- todo: Kumar needs to get with Leapfroggers to decide on date for dry run of tutorial
- decided against assigned seating
- Getting Started sections should be coded live, but not from scratch, and this needs more experimentation
- todo: experiment with using doctests as primers for exercises.  may or may not work.  what to about GUI?
- todo: doctests for integrity of example code - how do we do this?
- todo: add howto for pdb, traceback, bit operators?

3/8/2008

- move Getting Started in front of use cases
- intro to pdb
- alternate explanations of metaclasses?
- explanation of the python stack?
- luke: mention functools.wraps
- metaclasses: gobot vs. transformer (class collisions)
- luke: decorators: making the closure-ness explicit.
- tell people to run the code in their own editor / terminal as we are
- mention that code samples in recipes assume you have already completed the recipes

For live demo:
- not running step 0 in recipes, running and completing step 1
- skipping recipe #2 in each section

Frame Hacks
- getting started 1, no need to run this
- getting started 2, yes, run this
- getting started 3, no need to run this

Decorators:
- getting started 1, comment out @decorator
- getting started 2, also comment out @decorator
- getting started 3, also comment out @decorator, and maybe write 2.3 decorator style
- getting started 4, no need to run this
- getting started 5, no need to run this

Metaclasses
- getting started 1, no need to run this
- getting started 2, need to copy/paste both sections and run

Magic Methods
- getting started 1, no need to run this
- getting started 2, no need to run this
- getting started 3, skipping this one
- getting started 4, skipping this one
